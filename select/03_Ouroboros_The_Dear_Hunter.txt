I bet you thought that you'd succeed
Pulling the wool right over me
Hard to believe this snake stayed in the grass
Just long enough to catch your rabbit's feet
With telescoping glances
Hands romanced enticing you to keep
Laboring against the clock in spite of secrecy
You couldn't know revealed itself
To me the second you decided to compete
I fell down then I fell apart
I never wanted to hurt no one
I never wanted to be your city's son
I cried out to his crooked heart
I never wanted to hurt no one
No one but you
I bet you thought that you could breathe
A satisfied sigh of relief
A terrible thing, forgetting where you came from
Or have you trouble when you fall asleep
I've seen you fabricate, manipulate and here, you masquerade
But if we're poaching ghosts, you know I've got a few that I would raise
Settle yourself
As long as i'm protected
You can bet your secret's safe with me
I fell down then I fell apart
I never wanted to hurt no one
I never wanted to be your city's son
I cried out to his crooked heart
I never wanted to hurt no one
No one but you
Lost my soul
In the place of the great deceiver
Foolish hearts led foolish plans awry
They told me don't veer far from your home
Try never to leave her
Near I landed here I'll live and die
Travelled too far from the river's side
It wasn't long before I felt nothing below me
And all of the ground I thought I'd gained
Taken away
Thought I was strong; not strong enough
My mettle was bending
Foolish plans kissed foolish hearts goodbye
Travelled too far from the river's side
