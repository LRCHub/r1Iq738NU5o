In this moment, im cut right to the core
Cause i'm at war with mine, i can't stop crumbling
Look at me look at me now, with my back against the wall
Don't give in, try to find the balance
The relapse is killing me
no, take a breath and cave in,  you're weathered from the storm.
Oh what a life, I didn't mean it.
I'm torn in every way, I'm left frayed and so tired.
And most will never see the parts it takes from me,
Feel the pain with every breath, I feel the pain with every breath.
How can I cope when it's me that's the problem? There's no escape from yourself
I know, I'm the substance, that i tear apart
Inside me, lost with no control
In this moment, im cut right to the core
Cause i'm at war with mine, i can't stop crumbling
Look at me look at me now, with my back against the wall
Don't give in, try to find the balance
The relapse is killing me
So hide me away, hide me away
Cast out everything i know so that I can
Take all the blame, take all the blame
They wont even miss me at all
This is every thought inside,
i can't stop to think, its corrupting me
Cross out everything
I'm at war with the source of my consciousness, how can I survive?
