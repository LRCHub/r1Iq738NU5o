The ouroboros
Music: Andy Kuntz, Stephan Lill  Lyrics: Andy Kuntz
So here I am a broken thing
A ghost - invented in human brain
Here I await my latest death
If you forget me I can never rise up again
Wait another day - don´t give up any memories of me
Sweet hurting life
Acheronian ayre guide me on moonlight coloured ways
Tonight
I feel like I´m wounded by the human stain
Please say that you hear me Ivy
Sing my lonesome winter tale for you again
And so I am leaving to a new horizon
I forgive it and now I´m syncretizing ghostworlds
I see the light - see the morning
A million nights from the turning
I need to die to transform me
On my way into the light
I´m a serpent god
For renewal I am dying to refine the matter
This substance called my life
The wisdom of a ghost is ignited by the sting of mercy in my soulwork
And this is hurting - infecting me again and again
And so am leaving to a new horizon
I forgive you - and I´m syncretizing ghostworlds
I see the light see the dawning
A million light years from the turning
I need to die to transform me
On my way into the light
To all lost saints out in the universe
Send a Save Our Souls to the earth beyond
All your prayers - they´re never lost in space - for all time
To all the phantoms and ghosts - far beyond humankind
They have the right to live in their own space of time
Can you really be sure if we´re human or insane illusion
I see the light see the morning
Between the tides we´re immortal
I need to die to transform me
On my way into the light
And so I am leaving into a new horizon
I forgive it and I´m syncretizing both worlds Ivy
