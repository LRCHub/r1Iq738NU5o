In ages forgotten,
a Reaper was born
Spinning tales deathly belief
A yearning to traverse
that forest of thorns
In remembrance of
what lie beneath
The dangers abounding,
the horrors untold
Cloud my vision,
'till I cannot see
Peculiar enchantments
begin to unfold
And the Underworld calls
back to me
As the light grows
dimmer and fades...
Cross that river now,
Make our way beyond the gates
Release from our confinement
Together, we'll find it
The trail is fraught
with perils,
And yet, we don't mind it
But looking towards horizons
reminding me of then
Can't repent
Though I've hardly been spent
A journey downward toward
somewhere new, yet familiar
I'm learning how to stand
For the smile I swear to defend
Till the end
As we further descend, then
Shall we go?
To be swallowed fates below
A moment in history,
a flicker in time
A mystery I still can't
break through
Im deathly defiant of
crossing that line,
I don't want to break down
before you…
Reach downward to glory,
yet upward- what for?
An ouroboros of earthly desire
Devouring my tale
just to tell it once more
Am I still the gold statue
you admire?
Collecting all the stories
we've enjoyed
And reflecting on the thorns
that near destroyed me
I sang about a journey's end,
and now we come upon
Another one
The sun setting earlier
than believed
From this point downward,
I cannot return
For the final dream I sought is
so close yet far within my reach
Though I'd like it to be known
This I made on my own
Release from our confinement
Together, we'll find it
The trail is fraught
with perils,
And maybe all is
as it should be.
I promise I'll still be me
My mistakes
Somehow made a good story great
A journey downward toward
somewhere new, yet familiar
I'm learning how to stand
For the smiles I swear to defend
Till the end
As we further descend, then
Shall we go?
Swallowed up by what waits below
